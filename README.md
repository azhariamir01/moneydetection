# App Requirements

In order to run this application you need the following:
- Python >= 3.9
- PyCharm
- Git

The reason we use PyCharm is that it's an IDE that supports all the programming languages that we use for this 
application.  It supports JavaScript, HTML and CSS within the IDE, without needing additional frameworks or installations
outside the two mentioned above.
